# # We saw that Kaggle takes the test data (418 rows), only reports your 
# score on the leaderboard based on half of these data, and declares the winner
# based on the other half which is withholded until the very end of the competition. 
# Not only that, Kaggle does not tell you how they split the 418 rows. Say Kaggle 
# didnâ€™t do this and reported your score on the leaderboard based on the entire test data 
# (418 rows). Write 2-3 sentences outlining a strategy of how you could exploit the 
# information given by the leaderboard to get a perfect score of 100%.         
# #       
# 
# If all 418 rows of test data were used to compute the score then I could keep tweaking 
# and checking my predictions through resubmission until I got a perfect schoo. Essentially
# if all of the data were used in calculating the score, with enough work I could deduce
# the actual survival data from the test set through changes in scores from submission to submission.
