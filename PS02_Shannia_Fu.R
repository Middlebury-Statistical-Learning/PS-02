#We saw that Kaggle takes the test data (418 rows), only reports your score
#on the leaderboard based on half of these data, and declares the winner based
#on the other half which is withholded until the very end of the competition.
#Not only that, Kaggle does not tell you how they split the 418 rows.
#Say Kaggle didnâ€™t do this and reported your score on the leaderboard based on
#the entire test data (418 rows). Write 2-3 sentences outlining a strategy of
#how you could exploit the information given by the leaderboard to get a perfect
#score of 100%.

#You can submit any permutation of 1s and 0s (survived/died) until your score
#is 1.00000. If they let out all the scores without randomizing, at some point
#one of your 891^2 permutations will match all of the correct outcomes.
